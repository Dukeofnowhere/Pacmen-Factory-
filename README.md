## How to Run
Go to the "Projects" page on the main website and click on the  "Run Code" button. You will be taken to a page where you will see two buttons on the top left corner of the page named "Start Game" and "Add Pacman." Click "Start Game" and then click "Add Pacman" and watch the Pacman appear and spring into an eating frenzy as they bounce back and forth around the page.
