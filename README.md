#  PacMan Factory 

# link https://dukeofnowhere.github.io/Portfolio/Projects.html
## Description
The Pacman exercise is a fun and interactive javascript demostration of array manipulation. 
## How to Run
Click the link above. It will take you to the "Projects" page. When the project page loads, Click "Run Code" on the "Pacman Factory" project. You will be taken to a page where you will see two buttons on the top left corner of the page named "Start Game" and "Add Pacman." Click "Start Game" and then click "Add Pacman" and watch the Pacman appear and spring into an eating frenzy as they bounce back and forth around the page. 
## Roadmap
I would like to learn how to manipulate arrays more in depth. I would also like to improve my 
skillset when constructing setTimeout functions to activate certain features with in animations and/or other functionalities.
